SpeechZilla (alternative name :) OntoSpeech) is a speech analysis and classifier.  It will support 40 languages (right now, only English, not enough time to test the other ones)... no Bulgarian is not in them.
Example usages (simple) conference room, justice courts, school classes etc, public speeches
Complex (Automated Call centers)...etc

It can:  with Text Analytics from S4 can analyze the speech and extract useful information. Map it to a map, classify it.

Or better, try the app yourself.

Procedure to install the app:
-----

* Note * Your phone should have at least Android version 4.0.
 
##### Get the apk from
 \app\build\outputs\apk\app-debug.apk
 
- Copy the APK file over to the device; it doesn’t matter where you put it as long as you remember the location.
- Before you can actually install the APK file, you’ll need to tell your device that it can install any apps outside of the Play Store without throwing a fit. You can find this switch in your Settings –> Security –> Unknown Sources. Once this is enabled, you’re clear to fire up your file browser (I personally prefer ASTRO), locate the APK file, and open it. The Android OS should take over, identifying that the APK file is an app, and ask you whether you’d like to go ahead and install it, all permissions accounted for. After a couple seconds, your app should be installed and ready to go!
- Try to have a nice English (American or UK) accent if you plan to use your voice.
